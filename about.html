                <p>Chicago born, Indiana raised. Solution provider is my middle name. Feel free to check my birth certificate. Now for the real tea. I am an aspiring account manager who is ready to take on any challenge thrown my way. 
                    Connecting with clients is my forte, but let me let you in on a secret... I'm even better at giving them a campaign they are going to talk about for years to come.
                    No matter how vague, hopeless, or confusing advertising may be for a client, I can handle it! </p>

                <p>Fashion is my name, style is my game. I have so many interests I couldn't possibly name them all, but here's just a few: 90's and early 2000's movies and TV
                    doing my own nails, reading, fashion, makeup, and social media (ugh I know). But don't worry, I have so many more!
                </p>
                <p>I am here to meet all of your needs. 
                    Want a smooth campaign that satisfies the client and fulfills the creatives artistically? 
                    Don't worry, I'll get to negotiating! Looking for a new nail tech? Well, here I am! 
                    Need a shoulder to cry on or a bad cop to your good cop? Here I am with tissues and a foot to put down!
                </p>
                <p>But enough about me, don't let me forget to tell you all about my experience!</p>
